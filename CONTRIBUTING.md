# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, PR draft, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.
We find it more helpful to discuss your requirements before writing any code.

## Contributing to the code

```bash
# install dependencies
npm ci

# run tests
npm run test

# build
npm run build
```

See `/demo` folder to play with examples and ensure that everything works well after your changes.


## Are there other ways of contributing?

Absolutely! Try any of the following areas:

### Improve our documentation

If there's something in our documentation that you think needs spell checking, clearing up, additional code examples, or could be made better in some way, help us by opening an issue detailing the problem or a PR fixing it.

### Improve our issues

Issues are like a secondary means of documenting the project, and in cases where an issue is missing reproduction steps, please help us by co-ordinating with the original author to find out more details about their problem.

Once the source of the error has been found, you can be of further help by submitting a failing test case as a pull request.

### Send feedback on issues

Feedback on issues is very important and will shape the direction of the repository. Please help us by leaving constructive criticism on issues that matter to you.

Note that we don't find "+1" comments to be very helpful; instead, use GitHub reactions and subscribe to the thread to be notified of any progress. This helps to keep our discourse focused on the topic at hand.

### Review pull requests

It's really important to get more eyes on upcoming features and fixes. Please help by reviewing pull requests; even leaving a thumbs up reaction is better than nothing at all. Helping us to review means less time is wasted by all of us if a buggy release is cut.
